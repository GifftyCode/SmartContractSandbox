# SmartContractSandbox üîÆ
> My archive of small-scale smart contract projects and ideas.

## Overview
This repository serves as a personal playground and archive for experimenting with smart contract development. It contains various small-scale projects, proof-of-concepts, and implementation ideas using Solidity and other blockchain technologies.

## Featured Projects

### üßÆ Basic Calculator
A simple calculator contract demonstrating fundamental Solidity operations:
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- State management
- Basic error handling

### üí∞ Token Contracts
Various token implementation examples:
- ERC20 tokens
- ERC721 (NFT) tokens
- Custom token mechanics

### üîÑ DeFi Components
Small DeFi building blocks:
- Simple swaps
- Liquidity pools
- Yield farming mechanics

## Technologies Used
- Solidity ^0.8.0
- Hardhat
- OpenZeppelin
- Ethers.js
- Waffle/Chai for testing
